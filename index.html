              <div class="subheading mb-3">Hacksheffield, Hacknott and OxfordHack</div>
              <p>Hackathons are a 24-hour project where people are divided into teams and try to accomplish an idea using resources provided by the organisers. <br>
              ➢ I have learned how to work in teams with people I have never met. <br>
              ➢ I worked on projects using Arduino and software provided by Microsoft Azure. <br>
              ➢ I came up with an idea during OxfordHack to use Image recognition software provided by Azure to search for a car's number plates using street cameras in case of crime. I used C++ to write this program and we had some help from mentors provided. Although we did not win as it was very challenging, our project was recognized by organisers. <br></p>

              <p>➢ I Designed a Website with my team from scratch as a project for my High shcool. <br>
              ➢ I Used HTML and CSS to make our website. <br>
              ➢ Leadership : I was assigned as the leader of my team, so I had to delegate tasks according to everyone's expertise. I faced some challenges as a leader where some people could not do their work properly so I had to assign their work to someone else or do it myself. <br>
              ➢ Management : I used Milestones for management; where I divided tasks into smaller ones and then made a deadline for every task according to its significance and complexity. <br></p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>A team and I made a self-balancing robot as a project for kids to know more about engineering and how exciting it was to be an engineer. <br>
              ➢ I was responsible for the software part of the project where I had to make a PID controller using an Arduino. <br>
              ➢ It was challenging to tune the PID controller, however I overcame this by doing as much research as possible and reading other people's code and understanding it to modify it to our robot's specifications as our robot had different dimensions and mass. <br>
              ➢ Although everyone had his own tasks, I managed to apply knowledge sharing between us so that we can learn from each other's work and integrate our work together. <br></p>

              <p>I was inclusions officer in the Egyptian society.  <br>
                  ➢ We won the Cultural/National society award that year. <br>
                  ➢ People always thought that Egyptian society is merely for Egyptians and that's not true, So I had to change that by making sure that our events are diverse as possible and that they include everyone. <br>
                  ➢ I developed communication skills as it was my responsibility to talk to members about their experience and preferences. Also, we had a weekly meeting to discuss new events. <br></p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>Programming a PIC microcontroller in C to get the robot to follow a black line (University Project) <br>
                ➢ I used SparkFun infra-red sensors to detect a black line. <br>
                ➢ I used soldering to connect the electronic components with the microcontroller.  <br>
                The university provided us with soldering equipment in labs and I managed to design the circuit and solder it
                to the circuit board. <br>
                ➢ I used the concept of feedback control systems in programming for the robot to follow the
                black line. There were 8 sensors on the front of the robot. I managed to program the robot to
                keep the black line between el 4th and the 5th sensor so that the black line is at the centre of the
                robot. As the black line make any turns, the robot must follow. I managed to achieve that by
                calculating error which is distance between centre of the robot and the black line and then
                change robot's direction towards black line and multiply original speed of motor by error to
                increase the robot speed. As the robot goes further away from the line, robot's speed must
                increase in the opposite direction. <br>
